Had I been doing an analysis of any other state, then I'd put in 3 more criterion corruption , Law and order and cleanliness but in the case of Delhi, law and order comes under the purview of the Delhi police which in turn comes under the Home ministry and is BJP controlled Cleanliness comes under MCD which is BJP controlled And with regard to corruption, the anti corruption bureau was under the Delhi government until 2015 After that, it was taken away from them and now comes under the central government So it makes no sense to analyse the performance in all these cases because they do not come under the Aam Aadmi Party So viewing overall, adding up all the scores, the total of the report card amounts to a score of 31 out of 45 In percentage, this amounts to a 69% approximately       </div>
