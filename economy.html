A huge contrast is being witnessed in matters of economy While the GDP of the entire country is falling and the economic conditions are weakening such signs are not visible in Delhi The state GDP of Delhi in 2016-17 was 7.5% In 2018-19, it rose to 8.6% So the GDP figures for Delhi increased On average, a person residing in Delhi earns three times more Their income is three times more as compared to an average Indian So you can see how much more well off the people in Delhi are as compared to the rest of India The tax collection of the central government has begun to fall in the negatives But Delhi has been showing record growth in its tax collection As of 2018-19, there was a growth of 17.6% in tax collection in Delhi The Delhi budget has doubled in the past five years due to this record tax collection It has grown from 30,000 crores to 60,000 crores. It is an astonishing fact! because five years ago, everyone was saying that if the Aam Admi Party government comes to power, they would give out free water, free electricity and free education and the entire economy of Delhi would crash because of the freebies But the exact opposite of it is happening What are the reasons behind this? Kejriwal claims the reason behind this is that they have reduced corruption They have increased the efficiency of the government This efficiency has increased due to educated people, due to which, the economy is sailing so well despite handing out freebies While in the rest of the country, the taxes are rising but the economy is falling So they get 5 out of 5 for this outstanding performance.        </p>
