         In public transport, free metro and free bus rides were provided for women recently It has been promised that this would be made free for the students as well over the next five years Phase 4 has been approved for the expansion of the Delhi metro The construction had started in December 2019 and would be completed by 2024 but the Kejriwal government had promised that they would bring in 5000 new DTC buses But the reality is that the count of buses actually reduced as of March 2019 In 2010, there used to be 6,200 DTC buses By March 2019, their number fell to 3800 So there has been a negative performance in this area But recently, the government woke up and in November 2019, Chief Minister Kejriwal flagged off 100 new DTC buses These new buses have GPS trackers, Panic buttons, CCTVs and they even have hydraulic lifts for disabled people They also said that tenders have been issued for 3000 new buses which would arrive in the next 6 months But as of now, they have yet not arrived and since the promise had not been fulfilled over the past five years, so I'd like to give 1 out of 5 to the government in matters of public transport.
