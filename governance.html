          I've put the rest of the remaining things in this criteria of
          governance For example, they had promised free Wifi. As of now, 100
          Wifi hotspots exist in Delhi They had launched it in December which
          gives out 15 GB free data per person, per month and they claim that
          11,000 new Wifi hotspots would be ready in the next 6 months A record
          rise has been witnessed in the minimum wage which is another great
          thing According to the CAG, Delhi is the sole state in Delhi to run
          with a surplus budget This shows how well the economy of Delhi as well
          as management of money has been going No corruption scams have been
          seen in the government over the course of the last five years Talking
          about unique schemes, one of them was door step delivery of public
          services If you have to get your driving licence renewed or want to
          get your income certificate issued then it would be delivered at your
          doorstep Earlier, one had to go stand in long queues in offices This
          was an interesting scheme. Another one was Farishtey Yojana You would
          be awarded with a sum of 2,000 rupees if you helped any accident
          victim and bring them to the hospital Due to this Farishtey Yojana, as
          on February 1, 2018, more than 3,000 people have been saved.
