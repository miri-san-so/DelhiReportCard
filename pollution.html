        <p>
          Pollution has become a huge disaster in Delhi, NCR and the rest of North India in the past few years Although the main reason for this is the crop burning season in Punjab when the pollution peaks but an extreme effect of this is witnessed by the people in Delhi And no major steps have been taken by the government Reactive steps have been seen on the part of the government For example, the odd even rule, which was brought on only when the pollution aggravated The government started distributing masks to children in school to save themselves from pollution This is another very reactive step Not a lot of steps were taken to control it beforehand Pollution free Diwali was a great step taken by the government Light shows had been organized Talking about water pollution, Yamuna remains as polluted as it was before or maybe it has become more polluted The same white colored foam is visible in Yamuna till date The promise to clean up the Yamuna has been a total failure but a ray of hope is visible Last year, the Delhi government inaugurated India's largest sewage treatment plant The construction (of it) was inaugurated It has yet not been completed. It will be completed in 2022 So we might see an effect of it on the pollution in the river Yamuna Pollution might somewhat reduce But as of now, I'd like to give the government a score of 1 out of 5 in matters of pollution.
