          Even in matters of electricity, the Kejriwal government did what it
          promised Households get free electricity until 200 units and full
          subsidy is granted A subsidy of 50% is provided from 201 units to 400
          units Due to this, 14 lakh households in Delhi incur zero rupee
          electricity bill Additionally. the government also did not let the
          power tariffs rise due to which there has been a negligible increase
          in the bills for the rest of the people in Delhi in past 5 years
          Compare this with the rest of the states. For example, in Uttar
          Pradesh, the electricity bills were raised by 12% by the government
          last September in 2019 Recently, the Kejriwal government has come up
          with a new electric vehicle policy the aim of which is, to make sure
          that by 2024, out of all the cars in Delhi, 25% would be electric
          vehicles A lot of subsidies have been included in this If you wish to
          buy an electric car, then you would get a subsidy If you want to get
          an electric charging station installed in your house, then you'd get a
          subsidy Keeping in mind all of these things, there's nothing to
          complain about here Hence the government secures a 5 out of 5 in
          matters of electricity
