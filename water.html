        With regard to water, they had promised in the 2015 manifesto that 20,000 litres of free water would be given to every family every month And they did as they had said, They have kept their promise over the past five years, due to which Today, 13 lakh household incur a Zero rupee water bill But they had also promised a piped water supply to jhuggi jhopri clusters and unauthorized colonies But the March 2019 data of the Delhi Jal Board shows that they have been able to supply piped connections to merely 7 jhuggi jhopri clusters And even now there are more than 400 jhuggi jhopri clusters and more than 100 unauthorized colonies without piped water supply The promise of supplying clean water has only been partially fulfilled India Today had conducted an independent investigation recently where they went to 9 different constituencies in Delhi and took the water samples from there and tested whether they were fit to be used as drinking water or not So this investigation found out that 5 out of 9 samples were drinkable but 4 of them were not fit for drinking So that means that around slightly more than 50% is fit for drinking, but, water is not fit for drinking to a large extent Maybe this is the reason why, over the next five years, the Kejriwal government has promised that they would supply clean water as well as ensured a 24*7 supply of water We will have to wait and see when that is fulfilled but for these five years
